The code basically works in the following steps
+ Merges the __training__ and the __test__ sets to create one data set.
+ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
+ Assigns descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
+ Creates a second, independent __tidydata__ set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
+ Finally, writes the data in a text file as instructed in the assignment.
